# InfixToPostfix-Using-Pipes-Threads

## Project Overview

This calculator project converts infix notation to postfix and performs calculations using threading and pipes in C. Utilizing pipes and threads enhances performance by enabling concurrent execution of tasks rather than sequential processing.

## Repository Contents

- **C Code**: Implementation of infix to postfix conversion and calculation using pipes and threads.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanation of the project's functionality and code structure.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BelallSameh/InfixToPostfix-Using-Pipes-Threads.git
    cd InfixToPostfix-Using-Pipes-Threads
    ```

2. **Compile and Run**:
    - Compile the C code using your preferred compiler.
    - Execute the compiled program to see infix to postfix conversion and calculation using pipes and threads.

## Features

- **Infix to Postfix Conversion**: Convert mathematical expressions for efficient evaluation.
- **Threaded Execution**: Utilize threads for parallel processing of tasks.
- **Pipe Communication**: Use pipes for inter-process communication, enhancing program efficiency.
